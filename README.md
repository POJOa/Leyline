# Leyline 灵脉
A Web Development Workflow , Gendai Mahou made Simple.

The concept of Leyline comes from stories in Ancient English ~~, TYPE-MOON and various GALGAMES~~.

We build no more wheels , cuz it's not essential for Java Web.

Meanwhile , we provide a better integration for starting Web App development smoothly with most fresh and reliable techs.
